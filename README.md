<h3>I am Dylan Mendes<h3>
...
a current undergradute student of the University of Maryland College Park, MD. 
-- I am persuing a degree in chemistry while completed computational research, teaching myself to code, being a teaching assistant 
and having fun while doing it. 
-- In high school I learned basic Java but not to much extent. Recently however, after becoming more involved with research
an by nature coding I realize that it is something that I really like and that soothes me. 
-- Any help on any of my scripts would be great I haven't had the chance to take any classes where I would be able to because I 
have to muhc to do everyday. Don't let that fool you i am still coding away at 1 AM on a Friday wrtiting this I really want to learn 
to code and persure it as my career.
